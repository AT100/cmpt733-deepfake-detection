Our training dataset can be found at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19dXqC6xlCt7kNYtNFQSROAobmFe7gsSs?usp=sharing

Our validation dataset can be found at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14N8b-MTdtfI1f8xZbW6UmhR5io66-xvC?usp=sharing

Our web frontend is at https://cmpt733-309217.wn.r.appspot.com/. The associated Flask code and Web Templates can be found inside the "website" folder.

We downloaded our Kaggle datasets with notebooks download_data.ipynb and Kaggle.ipynb via Kaggle API.

Our facial capture from video frames methods can be found in face_detection_RetinaFace.ipynb, face_detection_cascade.ipynb and face_detection_mtcnn.ipynb.

Our models can be found in inception.ipynb, inception_deepfake.ipynb, vgg16.ipynb, xception_model.ipynb and 
mesonet_colab.ipynb.

I would recommend running our models in Google Colab so that you can sync with our Google Drive datasets using "from google.colab import drive
drive.mount("/content/drive")"
